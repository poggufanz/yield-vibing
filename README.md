# Vibing Farmer

> **Set once. Vibe forever.**

Most yield farming is exhausting. You find two or three vaults, swap into the assets, approve the spenders, and deposit—repeating a click-heavy loop over and over. Vibing Farmer changes this. We coordinate an AI agent swarm that automates this entire flow in parallel. You set your terms, review the worker skills once, and let the agents do the rest.

---

## How it works

1. **Strategy Generation**: Venice AI evaluates your intent (deposit amount, risk tolerance, and number of target vaults) to compile a custom multi-vault allocation plan and action-level agent skills.
2. **User Review**: You inspect the auto-generated skill JSON in an interactive editor. You can adjust slippage parameters, set spend caps, or approve them as-is.
3. **Smart Account Upgrade**: A single EIP-7702 signature upgrades your MetaMask Flask account into a temporary smart account.
4. **Batched Permission**: You authorize scoped worker agents via an ERC-7715 batched permission request. Each agent is strictly confined to its assigned vault and budget.
5. **Parallel Execution**: The Orchestrator Agent spawns parallel Worker Agents to execute the transactions. Each worker carries out its specific Swap → Approve → Deposit sequence gaslessly via the 1Shot Permissionless Relayer.
6. **Real-time Monitoring**: The frontend visualizes the active agent swarm, execution stages, and persistent agent memories in a live network graph.

## The Vision

Most Web3 tools treat users like transaction-signing robots. We wanted to build something that feels like a natural step toward Web4. You express your investment intent once, AI coordinates the strategy and drafts the boundaries, and parallel worker agents carry it out. 

Blockchain shouldn't be the interface; it is the cryptographic boundary that keeps the agents completely honest.
