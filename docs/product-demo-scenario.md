# Demo Scenario — Vibing Farmer

> **Skill Reference:** mobile-developer + blockchain-developer + cognitive-fluency-psychology
> **Version:** 2.0 | **Date:** May 27, 2026
> **Purpose:** End-to-end demo flow guide for the hackathon video submission

---

## 1. Demo Objectives

To demonstrate that Vibing Farmer successfully automates a multi-vault deposit flow using an agent swarm—from intent input to confirmation of all vaults on Sepolia. This workflow features Venice AI as the coordinator, a user-reviewable skill system, and real-time visualization on a vis.js graph.

**Core Demo Narrative:**
> "You have 100 USDC. Typically, this requires 8 MetaMask popups per vault and 15 minutes of your time. With Vibing Farmer, Venice AI automatically generates the strategy and agent skill sets. You review and approve them once, and the agent swarm executes two parallel vaults—completely gasless. Set once. Vibe forever."

## 2. Demo Personas

| Persona | Name | Profile |
|---------|------|--------|
| Active Yield Farmer | Arya | Has 100 USDC, wants efficient multi-vault yield farming, wishes to avoid repeating 8 popups per vault |
| Observer (Video Viewer) | Judge / Developer | Evaluating the integration of MetaMask, 1Shot, Venice AI, and agent coordination |

---

## 3. Step-by-Step Demo Flow

### Step 0: Preparation (Pre-Recording)

- MetaMask Flask installed (not regular MetaMask) with a Sepolia account ready.
- AgentVaultDepositor and 2x MockVault deployed on Sepolia.
- 100 testnet USDC available in the demo wallet.
- Venice AI API key configured.
- `agents/memory/` contains at least one memory entry from a previous session (optional, but highly recommended to showcase memory capability).

---

### Step 1: Input Intent into Venice AI (0:00–0:45)

1. Open Vibing Farmer in the browser.
2. Show the input form:
   - "How much USDC do you have?" → 100 USDC
   - "Risk level?" → Low
   - "How many vaults?" → 2
3. Click "Generate Strategy".
4. Venice AI returns a response:
   - **Strategy:** 50 USDC to MockVault USDC-A (APY: 7.8%), 50 USDC to MockVault USDC-B (APY: 8.2%).
   - **Agent 1 skills:** `{ swap: { maxSlippage: 0.5, dexPreference: "uniswap-v3" }, deposit: { maxAmount: 50000000, vault: "0xVaultA" } }`
   - **Agent 2 skills:** `{ swap: { maxSlippage: 0.5, dexPreference: "uniswap-v3" }, deposit: { maxAmount: 50000000, vault: "0xVaultB" } }`
   - **Privacy note:** "This strategy is processed via Venice AI — no data is retained."

**Visuals shown:** Strategy card + 2 skill cards (Agent 1 and Agent 2).

---

### Step 2: Review & Approve Skill Sets (0:45–1:15)

1. The UI displays two editable Skill Cards:
   - **Agent 1:** maxSlippage: 0.5% | vault: MockVault USDC-A | maxAmount: 50 USDC
   - **Agent 2:** maxSlippage: 0.5% | vault: MockVault USDC-B | maxAmount: 50 USDC
2. Demo action: change Agent 2 maxSlippage to 0.3% (to showcase editability).
3. Click "Approve Skill Sets".
4. UI updates: "Skills approved — agents ready" ✓

**Visuals shown:** Editable skill form + approve button.

---

### Step 3: Connect Wallet + EIP-7702 Upgrade (1:15–2:00)

1. Click the "Connect Wallet" button.
2. MetaMask Flask popup appears → select account.
3. The app detects the account as an EOA.
4. Information displayed: "Your account will be upgraded to a Smart Account via EIP-7702".
5. MetaMask Flask displays the authorization request.
6. The user signs the transaction → the account now functions as a smart account.
7. UI updates: "Smart Account Active" badge ✓

**Visuals:** MetaMask Flask authorization dialog + status badge (EOA → Smart Account).

---

### Step 4: Grant ERC-7715 Permissions (2:00–2:30)

1. The UI displays two permission request cards (one per agent):
   - **Agent 1:** "Authorize swap max **50 USDC** and deposit into vault **MockVault USDC-A (0xVaultA)**. Expiry: 24 hours."
   - **Agent 2:** "Authorize swap max **50 USDC** and deposit into vault **MockVault USDC-B (0xVaultB)**. Expiry: 24 hours."
2. The user clicks "Grant Permissions for All Agents".
3. MetaMask Flask displays the `wallet_requestExecutionPermissions` dialog (either twice or batched).
4. The user approves → UI updates: "2 agent permissions active" ✓

**Visuals:** Permission cards per agent + MetaMask dialog.

---

### Step 5: Agent Swarm Parallel Execution (2:30–3:30)

1. The vis.js Network graph appears:
   - Center node: **Orchestrator Agent** (blue, running)
   - Edges connecting to: **Worker Agent 1** (grey) + **Worker Agent 2** (grey)
   - Edges from Workers to: **MockVault A** + **MockVault B**

2. Click "Launch Agent Swarm" → Orchestrator dispatches Workers in parallel.

3. **Worker Agent 1** (left):
   - `AgentStarted` event → node changes from grey to blue (running)
   - `SwapExecuted` → "Swap 50 USDC ✓"
   - `ApproveExecuted` → "Approve VaultA ✓"
   - `DepositExecuted` → node changes from blue to green (confirmed) ✓

4. **Worker Agent 2** (right, running simultaneously):
   - Performs the exact same steps as Agent 1 but targeted at VaultB.
   - Both agents run **simultaneously on the graph**.

5. `AgentCompleted` events → all nodes turn green.
6. No MetaMask popups appear during execution (all actions occur via 1Shot relay).

**Visuals:** A vis.js graph showing two Workers running in parallel with nodes changing color in real-time.

---

### Step 6: Memory in Node Details (3:30–3:50)

1. Click the **Worker Agent 1** node on the graph.
2. The details panel appears:
   - Skills utilized: `{ swap: { maxSlippage: 0.5 }, deposit: { maxAmount: 50000000 } }`
   - Memory entries:
     ```
     step: swap | status: success | executionTime: 4.2s | slippage: 0.12%
     step: deposit | status: success | shares: 50023456 | executionTime: 3.8s
     lesson: "MockVault A reliable with 0.5% slippage"
     ```
3. Explain that this memory will be read by Venice AI in subsequent executions.

**Visuals:** Node details panel with the skill JSON and memory entries.

---

### Step 7: Verification on Sepolia Etherscan (3:50–4:20)

1. Click the Etherscan link on one of the Agent nodes.
2. Show the transaction on Sepolia:
   - `from` = 1Shot relayer address (NOT the user's wallet) → verifying gas abstraction.
   - Events: `AgentStarted`, `SwapExecuted`, `ApproveExecuted`, `DepositExecuted`, `AgentCompleted`.
   - MockVault balance increases.

---

### Step 8: Closing (4:20–4:45)

- Summary:
  - "100 USDC → deposited into 2 vaults in < 60 seconds."
  - "Venice AI generates the strategy and skills, which the user reviews once."
  - "2 parallel agents, 0 gas, 0 manual transactions."
  - "Set once. Vibe forever."
- Display the 4 prize tracks achieved.
